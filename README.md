# Add Page to OSRS Table Backup (multiple pages)

This bookmarklet saves the current Old School RuneScape Wiki page’s `rs:lightTable` highlights to your browser’s localStorage, allowing you to build a backup of highlighted tables across multiple pages.

## How to Use

1. Copy the **minified** code from `osrs-add-page-to-table-backup.min.js`.
2. Create a new bookmark in your browser.
3. Paste the minified code into the bookmark’s URL/location field.
4. Visit any OSRS Wiki page with lighttables.
5. Click the bookmark to save that page’s lighttable highlight data locally.

## Notes

- The saved data is stored under the key `osrsTableBackup` in your browser’s localStorage.
- This data is only accessible from your browser; it is not sent to any external servers.
- To view or export saved data, use your other backup/export tools.
